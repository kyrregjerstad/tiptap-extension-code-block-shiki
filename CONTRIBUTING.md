# How to contribute

## Contribute with PRs

First for all, thanks for contributing! To contribue code, open a Pull Request with your changes.

I'd kindly ask you to not format existing code, like adding semicolons or changing single quotes to double quotes everywhere. If you contribute code, focus on your changes, and nothing else.

## Developing locally

Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Run tests:

```
pnpm test
```

Run dev playground:

```
pnpm dev
```
